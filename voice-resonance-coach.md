# Resonance Coach: Concept Overview

## Product Vision
Resonance Coach helps sales professionals build a confident, resonant speaking voice. Users receive fast, ADHD-friendly voice workouts, real-time visual feedback, and AI-guided coaching grounded in acoustic science.

## Target Outcomes
- Increase vocal clarity, projection, and resonance for sales calls.
- Improve self-awareness of articulation, pacing, and emotional tone.
- Maintain consistent practice through quick, gamified drills and reminders.

## Core User Flow
1. **Warm Welcome & Baseline**
   - 30-second onboarding script introduces the experience.
   - User records a short pitch; the app captures spectral baseline (formant balance, harmonic richness, noise ratio) and speech metrics (pace, articulation, filler words).
2. **Instant Insights**
   - Dashboard shows traffic-light indicators with tooltips explaining what each metric means in plain language.
   - AI coach summarizes strengths, opportunities, and a single focus cue for the next drill.
3. **Guided Drills**
   - Bite-sized, 2-minute sessions focusing on breath support, resonance placement, articulation, and expressive pacing.
   - Each drill blends:
     - Audio prompts from pro voice coaches.
     - Live spectral visualizations highlighting optimal frequency bands.
     - Haptic cues or short animations to reinforce posture and breath.
4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Weekly "Pitch Snapshot" compares new recordings to baseline, tracking resonance gains and clarity.
   - Users earn streaks, badges, and shareable progress cards to stay motivated.
5. **Sales Enablement Tie-ins**
   - Upload call clips (Zoom, Gong, Chorus) for targeted feedback on real scenarios.
   - Integrations push notable improvements or coaching tips to CRM/Slack.

## Key Features & Modules
- **AI Feedback Engine**
  - Upload or record audio; pipeline performs noise reduction, voice activity detection, spectral feature extraction, and speech-to-text alignment.
  - LLM-powered coach generates actionable advice using acoustic metrics, transcript analysis, and persona-specific goals.
- **Live Resonance Visualizer**
  - Web audio capture feeds into WebAssembly-accelerated spectral analysis (FFT, formant tracking) with responsive color-coded visuals.
- **Practice Library**
  - Curated drills categorized by goal (resonance, articulation, pacing, storytelling).
  - Adaptive scheduling recommends the next drill based on performance and time since last practice.
- **Progress Intelligence**
  - Trends on resonance index, clarity score, and energy modulation.
  - AI summary highlights wins, risks, and recommends next steps.
- **Social Accountability**
  - Optional "practice pods" match peers for asynchronous feedback.
  - Streak reminders and calendar sync keep sessions top-of-mind.

## Differentiators
- Combines professional vocal pedagogy with explainable AI insights tailored to sales scenarios.
- ADHD-friendly micro-coaching: short sessions, clear single-focus cues, visual reinforcement, and gamified accountability.
- Integrates with sales tooling, letting users apply improvements directly to revenue-driving conversations.

## Technology Stack Recommendations
- **Frontend:** React (Next.js) with Web Audio API, Tailwind CSS for rapid UI iterations, Tone.js for audio prompts.
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) for ingestion & ML orchestration; WebSocket support for live feedback.
- **Audio Analytics:** PyTorch + torchaudio or TensorFlow for spectral feature extraction; pretrained models for voice quality estimation (e.g., CREPE for pitch tracking, wav2vec2 for ASR).
- **LLM Coaching:** Fine-tuned instruction-following model leveraging acoustic metrics and user goals.
- **Data Store:** PostgreSQL for user data; object storage (S3) for audio clips; Redis for session state.
- **Infrastructure:** Containerized deployment (Docker, Kubernetes); GPU-enabled workers for batch analysis; edge caching via CDN for prompt UI response.
- **Privacy & Security:** End-to-end encryption, on-device preprocessing option, GDPR/CCPA compliant retention policies.

## Roadmap Milestones
1. **Prototype (Weeks 1-4)**
   - Build recording/upload MVP with baseline analysis and LLM-generated feedback.
   - Implement simple resonance score and articulation clarity metrics.
2. **Beta (Weeks 5-10)**
   - Add live drill mode, gamified progress dashboard, and CRM integrations.
   - Conduct usability testing with sales teams; refine ADHD-friendly UX (short loops, bold CTA, progress nudges).
3. **Launch (Weeks 11-16)**
   - Harden infrastructure, add practice pods, finalize analytics storytelling.
   - Marketing materials featuring before/after audio comparisons and testimonial case studies.

## Success Metrics
- 85% of weekly active users complete at least three micro-drills per week.
- 40% reduction in filler words and mumbling frequency over 8 weeks for active users.
- Net Promoter Score â‰¥ 45 within first three months.

## Future Extensions
- Personalized vocal warm-ups generated from calendar context (e.g., big demo days).
- Live call plug-in delivering subtle real-time cues (pace, energy) via wearable.
- Partnerships with speech therapists and executive coaches for premium tiers.
